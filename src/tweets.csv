      Nothing should be attributed to conspiracy that can be explained by error or a succession of errors.
      
Example 1: The alleged conspiracy to ""fake"" the Apollo moon landing.
      Such an undertaking would be so likely to result in multiple glitches that it would be nearly impossible to pull off.  Thus, conspiracy is an unlikely explanation of events.  Accordingly, the ""evidence"" of the ""faked"" landing is more likely a result of the errors of those interpreting the evidence than of the evil design of the alleged conspirators.
Example 2:  The Warren Report.
      Any open questions in the Warren Report are more likely the result of the errors of the Warren commission, or the errors of those interpreting the Warren Report, than the result of a conspiracy to cover up the true facts.
